# N.B
# 	Notice that we changed the argument of hotel_costs() from nights to days - 1.
#   Since we want trip_cost() to only depend on two parameters, 
#   we have to convert the variable nights into days. 
#   If you are going to be staying somewhere, 
#   the number of nights you stay there is one less than the number of days you were there 
#   (imagine a weekend trip to visit family, you leave Saturday and return Sunday, 
#    so you visit for two days, but only stay for one night).
